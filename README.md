# Collection Views Versus Tables Views

- Unlike tables, collections introduce a Layout - a class that specifies how items are placed onscreens. 
- Layouts organize the location of each cell, so items appear exactly where needed.

# Implementation

``` objective-c
UICollectionViewController *collectionViewController = [[UICollectionViewController alloc] initWithCollectionViewLayout:layout]
```
